## Overview

### Motivation

Designing a plugin system involves two tightly coupled challenges:

- On the host application side: implementing a structured and extensible architecture.
- On the plugin side: conforming to a standardized interface and integration protocol.

In the absence of a formalized framework, host developers must manually implement plugin discovery, validation, registration, and integration. Plugin developers, in turn, must reverse-engineer the hostâ€™s
expectations. This fragmented process increases complexity and hinders maintainability.

Furthermore, seamless plugin usage by end users requires reliable loading and execution mechanisms
at runtime, with limited visibility into internal plugin logic.

### Advantages

This framework provides a unified infrastructure to automate plugin management and decouple
architectural design from application-specific functionality.

It defines standardized procedures for all three actors in the plugin ecosystem:

- **Host applications**: Define and expose plugin interfaces, manage discovery and registration, and
  coordinate runtime execution.
- **Plugin developers**: Implement compliant modules with minimal boilerplate, following validated
  integration specifications.
- **End users**: Install and activate plugins transparently within the host application environment,
  without manual configuration.

---

## Features

- [X] **Plugin Specification**: Defines a common interface for plugins to ensure compatibility with
  the host application.
- [ ] **Plugin Discovery**: Offers various strategies to locate plugins from multiple sources, that
  can be automatically or manually triggered either by the host application or by the user.
- [X] **Plugin Validation**: Ensures that plugins conform to the expected schema and are compatible
  with the host application.
- [ ] **Plugin Registration**: Enable/disable plugins and organizes their resources to make them
  available to the host application flexibly.
- [X] **Extensible CLI Framework**: Provides a modular command-line interface (CLI) that can be
  extended with new commands provided by plugins. Commands and nested groups can be composed to
  assemble the main application.
